# How Git works
Git keeps track of changes in your project files and directories.
It ignores any files or folders specified in the `.gitignore` file.

> git init .  
Initializes an empty git repository in the current folder

> git remote add github https://github.com/HonoCorp/python-demo.git  
Adds a new remote called `github`, located at the url `https://github.com/HonoCorp/python-demo.git` to our local environment.

> git remote -v  
Lists all remotes that have been added to our local environment

Git has three main environments for any repository it is tracking:  
1. Working Tree
2. Staging area
3. HEAD
